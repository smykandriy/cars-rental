# UML Class Diagram

The diagram focuses on core domain models (users, cars, rentals, deposits, penalties, transactions) and the main service classes used for pricing, rental state transitions, reporting, and invoice building. It reflects the relationships between these entities and highlights how services collaborate with models.

See `class_diagram.puml` for the UML class diagram.
